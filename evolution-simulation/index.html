        <p>
            For the final project of my CS2 class, I designed an evolution simulation in the Java programming language.
            The simulation takes place on a grid of tiles, each with a certain amount of grass, indicated by the
            brightness of the tile.
            An organism is has a head segment, followed by a tree of stomachs and legs. Each stomach increases food
            capacity and each leg increases move speed.
            In each cycle of the simulation, the grass grows following a logistic growth curve, then the organisms
            update.
            An organisms will move in the direction of the nearest grass tile with the most grass, within its field of
            view.
            It will then eat as much grass as its stomachs can contain from the tile it ends up on.
            After that it will consume a certain amount of the food that is required by its appendages.
            If it has enough food left over, it will asexually reproduce and lay and egg that will hatch in the next
            cycle.
            Children have random mutations that differentiate them from their parents.
            If an organisms runs out of food it will die.
